# Random-Lightbulbs

In this little simulation, there is a box of 70 lightbulbs among which there are 10 of each of the 7 unique colors. The goal is to calculate the expected number of unique colors in a sample of 20 bulbs from this reservoir. The user specifies the number of simulations that are used to calculate this expected value, which is basically the average of the number of unique colors in all the samples taken.
